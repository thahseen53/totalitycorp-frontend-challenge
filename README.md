# E-commerce React Website with Vite and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to our e-commerce website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS! This project allows users to browse products, add items to the cart, filter products, and place orders. We've implemented the core functionality using React's Context API and Reducer for managing the cart and product filtering.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **Context API:** A built-in state management solution for React applications.
- **Reducer:** A function used with the Context API for managing complex state changes.

## Implementation Details

We've implemented the cart and product filtering functionality using React's Context API and Reducer. This approach allows us to manage the application's state in a centralized manner, making it easy to maintain and scale.

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- `src/contexts/`: Contains the Context API providers and reducers for cart management and product filtering.
- `src/components/`: Contains React components used throughout the application.
- `src/pages/`: Defines the main pages of the website.
- `src/data/`: Stores sample product data.
- `src/styles/`: Custom CSS and Tailwind CSS styles.
